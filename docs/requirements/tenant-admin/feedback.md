# Feedback — Hospital IT / Tenant Admin (R02)

Stakeholder review loop for the Hospital IT / Tenant Admin requirements package.
Package version: see [README.md](README.md). Review target: all artifacts
(`01`–`08`) with focus on the open questions below.

## Primary Stakeholder

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Role** | Tenant IT administrator |
| **Package** | `docs/requirements/tenant-admin/` |
| **Review due** | 2026-08-10 (1 week after post-merge alignment) |
| **Gate** | Package stays `approved`/`draft` per review outcome; each item below must resolve to `resolved` or `deferred` with rationale |

## How to Submit Feedback

For each item, record: artifact + section affected (e.g., `08-implementation-roadmap.md`, "Phase 2"),
the feedback, and a proposed disposition. The requirements architect then updates the relevant
artifact(s), re-runs the quality gates (`scripts/validate-requirements.sh tenant-admin` + Sections 6.1–6.4
of the skill), and moves the item to `resolved` or `deferred` with rationale.

## Open Questions (seeded from post-merge alignment, 2026-08-03)
